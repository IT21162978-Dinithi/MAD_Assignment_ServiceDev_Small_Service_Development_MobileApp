# ServiceDev
# Small Service Development App
# Introduction to the project

#Nowadays unemployment affected to most people In Sri Lanka. Small paid workers such as 
housecleaners, babysitters, painters lost their jobs. To overcome from this economic crisis of 
them we are planning to develop an android app called service dev. Users can simply register 
for the app and they can be service provider as well as customer. Users can manage their own 
profile details up to some extends.
Through this app service providers can add their preferred services and Customers can get the 
services from them. customer can book them through the booking system and can pay them 
through our payment system. It there are any services that we need later, we can save those 
services. Through this app we can see our service booking history. Also, customer can add the 
service quality of the service providers, using feedback.
Thought this app service providers can add their services and set their availability and hourly 
rates. They can manage their service details and they can add more than one service. After 
customer request the service, the service provider informs about it through our notification 
system. 
This app is open for everyone and anyone can use this app easily.
